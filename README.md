## Introduction

In software development, design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems that occur during the design and implementation of software systems. They provide a structured approach to solving these problems and promote code reusability, maintainability, and scalability.

This repository covers three main categories of design patterns:

## Creational Patterns

Creational patterns focus on object creation mechanisms, providing flexibility in creating objects while hiding the creation logic. Some of the creational patterns covered in this repository include:

- Singleton
- Factory Method
- Abstract Factory
- Builder
- Prototype

## Structural Patterns

Structural patterns deal with the composition of classes and objects, providing ways to form larger structures while keeping them flexible and efficient. Some of the structural patterns covered in this repository include:

- Adapter
- Decorator
- Proxy
- Composite
- Facade

## Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral patterns focus on the interaction between objects, defining how they communicate and collaborate to achieve a specific behavior. Some of the behavioral patterns covered in this repository include:

- Observer
- Strategy
- Command
- Iterator
- Template Method
